Task1: Covert Array to ArrayList

Array: Array is a containter objects that hold a fixed number of value in single type
ArrayList: Used to store dynamically size collect of elements or objects
Difference: Array--> Fixed size data structure, contain both primitive data type hence
	    ArrayList--> dynamically size arrays that implement List interface.only supprot object entry not primitive but 
convert primitive data type into Interger object

1. Convert Array to ArrayList by using Arrays.asList()method
2. Convert Array to ArrayList by Collections.addAll()method
3. Convert Array to ArrayList by for looping manually

Task 2: Convert ArrayList to Array
1st method: toArray() declare array in null then method: itemArray = item.toArray(new String[item.size()]);
2nd : Manually by for looping


/* 

  We have a class that models navigation items for our client websites.

  There is a root level item which is not displayed, but contains a list of child items.

  These child items may have child items, which may also have child items, to an arbitrary level of depth.

  Write a method in C# or Java that takes in the root level NavigationItem and prints out the navigation structure
  in a format that a non-developer could understand and use to help them troubleshoot issues with a site. 

  You can assume that all Lists of children are non-null and have length of zero when they are empty.

public class NavigationItem {
    public string Url;
    public string Label;
    public List<NavigationItem> Children;
